## Overview

**NoteRender** is a deterministic, local-first rendering engine that converts Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) into clean, professional PDF documents.

It is built for:
- students preparing academic submissions,
- engineers exporting technical reports,
- researchers publishing notebook-based work,
- and teams that need **reproducible, template-driven PDFs**.

Unlike browser-based or cloud converters, NoteRender runs entirely **locally**, providing full control over formatting, privacy, and output consistency.

## Features

- Convert `.ipynb` notebooks directly to PDF
- Consistent layout with configurable templates
- Automatic page numbers, headers, and footers
- Academic and college-friendly formatting
- Local-first execution (no cloud dependency)
- Deterministic output (same input → same PDF)
- CLI-first and scriptable
- Minimal configuration, explicit behavior

## Why NoteRender?

Most notebook-to-PDF workflows are:
- fragile,
- browser-dependent,
- or difficult to customize for academic standards.

**NoteRender** prioritizes:
- reliability over magic,
- explicit configuration over hidden defaults,
- boring, predictable output (this is a feature).
